# GDP_data

In this project, I am given a dataset regarding six different countries. The information given are life expectancy at birth and GDP from the years 2000-2015. After exploring the data, I plotted the life exp. and GDP for all the diffent countires overtime. I then proceeded to calculate the Pearson r coefficent for each of the variable pairs, total of three r values per country. Different countries show different r values. For example, in some countries, life expectancy is more correlated with time than with GDP. I then proceeded to build a linear model with time and life exp. as features and GDP as target. I used the whole dataset as my training data and values from 2016-2021 as my test data. The more recent values were aquired from a diffrent source. I tested my model on two different countries and in both cases the model was underestimating the GDP value. Future work consists on applying the model in all six countries.
